Because it requires strong consensuses between people working together. So I&#8217;ve wanted to turn DDD into something that we can physically see. Here&#8217;s how I did.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class=c2></span></p><p class=c0><span class=c2>DDD&#8217;s core is composed of:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_5cknvt4fn188-0 start"><li class="c0 c10"><span class=c2>Contexts</span></li><li class="c0 c10"><span class=c2>Contextual boundaries</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c12"><span class=c2></span></p><p class=c0><span class=c2>Because they define domains. A domain is a set of perceptions of a thing and use cases, which are derived by a context and its boundaries to the related contexts.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class=c2></span></p><p class=c0><span class=c2>To enable "touchable DDD&#8221;, at the organization-level, you can have small teams that handle different contexts (domains). Maybe you want to make a team to handle multiple contexts as team&#8217;s capacity is larger than a context&#8217;s cost. Similarly, at code-level, we can have a package to separate a context.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class=c2></span></p><p class=c0><span class=c2>You might have noticed it already, but this is not different from what we&#8217;re doing. What I want to say here is that you just didn&#8217;t know the fitting size of a context or you didn&#8217;t even define a context clearly. Such as an unintended monolith that you often suffer from.</span></p><p class="c0 c12"><span class=c2></span></p></article><section class=post-nav><ul><li><a href=https://dyong1.github.io/blog/2020/04/29/my-website-is-running/>> Previous post: My website is running</a></li><li><a href=https://dyong1.github.io/blog/2020/04/30/practical-domain-driven-development-in-your-code/>> Next post: Practical Domain-Driven Development in your code</a></li></ul></section></section></main></body></html>
